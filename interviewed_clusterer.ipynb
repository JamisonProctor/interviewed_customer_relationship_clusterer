    "### Clustering Method for Analyzing Relationships Between Interviewed and Non-interviewed Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Overview\n",
    "This data science project delves into a scenario with 200 customers, of which 10 have participated in in-depth discovery interviews. Our goal is to identify patterns and similarities between the interviewed and non-interviewed groups to better understand customer needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals\n",
    "- **Identify Similarities:** We use clustering algorithms to detect similarities and patterns in customer behavior and preferences.\n",
    "- **Extrapolate Interview Insights:** Insights from the interviews are leveraged to gain a deeper understanding of the entire customer base.\n",
    "- **Enhance Value Delivery:** These findings will inform strategies to improve efficiency in delivering value to all customers, especially those not interviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "Our methodology involves a detailed analysis of customer data, utilizing clustering techniques to categorize customers based on various attributes. This process aims to reveal the extent to which non-interviewed customers resemble those interviewed, allowing us to apply these insights more broadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Source\n",
    "[Our customer data, sourced from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/customer-data), comprises 200 data points with the following features:\n",
    "- **CustomerID:** Assigned IDs range from 1 to 200.\n",
    "- **Gender:** Distribution includes 56% Female and 44% Male customers.\n",
    "- **Age:** Customers aged between 18 and 70 years.\n",
    "- **Annual Income:** Ranges from $15,000 to $137,000.\n",
    "- **Spending Score:** Scored between 1 and 99, indicating purchasing behavior.\n"
