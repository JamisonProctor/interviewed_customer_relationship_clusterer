    "### Clustering Method Exploration: Analyzing Relationships Between Interviewed and Non-interviewed Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Overview\n",
    "In this solo data science project, I explore clustering methods using a dataset of 200 customers, where 10 have undergone in-depth discovery interviews. My aim is to discover patterns and similarities between the interviewed and non-interviewed customers, enhancing my understanding of diverse customer needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "- **Uncover Similarities:** Utilizing clustering algorithms to unearth patterns in customer behavior and preferences.\n",
    "- **Extrapolate Interview Insights:** Applying insights from the interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the entire customer base, on an individual basis.\n",
    "- **Enhance Personal Learning:** This project serves as a means to improve my skills in delivering data-driven insights, focusing on customers who have not been interviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "The project involves a detailed analysis of customer data, using clustering techniques to categorize customers based on various attributes. This individual exploration aims to reveal how non-interviewed customers resemble those interviewed, enhancing my personal understanding and application of data science methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Source\n",
    "The data, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/customer-data), encompasses 200 data points with features such as:\n",
    "- **CustomerID:** IDs ranging from 1 to 200.\n",
    "- **Gender:** Includes 56% Female and 44% Male customers.\n",
    "- **Age:** Customer ages between 18 and 70 years.\n",
    "- **Annual Income:** Ranging from $15,000 to $137,000.\n",
    "- **Spending Score:** Scores between 1 and 99, indicating purchasing behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a personal venture to delve into data science methodologies, focusing on clustering techniques.\n"
